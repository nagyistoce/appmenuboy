## Tips ##

I organize my Applications folder so that only apps from Apple are in it. For other apps, I create a small number of subfolders. That way, my `AppMenuBoy` menu does not need to scroll.

I click and hold on `AppMenuBoy`'s Dock icon to reveal `AppMenuBoy`'s Dock menu, but you can also do it by holding down the {Control} key and click once on `AppMenuBoy`'s Dock icon.

You don't need to hold down the {Control} key once the menu appears.

But If you do, and you need to scroll the `AppMenuBoy` menu, be warned: In System Preferences, Universal Access, on the Seeing pane, Zoom section, there is an Options button. Press it, and there is a checkbox: "Use scroll wheel with modifier keys to zoom".

The comment box at the bottom of this page is tempting. Resist!  Rather than entering a comment here, please go to the `AppMenuBoy` [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/appmenuboy), and enter it there.

Enter it in the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/appmenuboy), and it will email those of us who care about `AppMenuBoy`. Enter it here, and we won't see it for a long time.
